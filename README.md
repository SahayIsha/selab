Decentralization: Blockchain operates without a central authority, distributing data across multiple nodes in a network.

Immutable Ledger: Once data is recorded in a block, it cannot be altered, ensuring transparency and trust.

Cryptographic Security: Data in a blockchain is secured using cryptographic techniques, making it tamper-proof.

Smart Contracts: Blockchain enables self-executing contracts with predefined rules, automating various processes.

Transparency: All participants in the network can view the blockchain's data, enhancing accountability.

Cost Efficiency: By eliminating intermediaries, blockchain reduces transaction costs in areas like finance and supply chain.

Applications Beyond Cryptocurrency: While known for supporting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, blockchain is also used in industries like healthcare, logistics, and real estate.

Consensus Mechanisms: Blockchain relies on mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) to validate transactions and maintain integrity.

Traceability: In supply chains, blockchain helps track and verify product origins and movements.

Scalability Challenges: Despite its potential, blockchain networks face scalability issues, particularly with high transaction volumes.
